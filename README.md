## 🛒 **Overview**  
The Blockchain Voting System (BVS) is a decentralized application that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof digital voting. Built on blockchain technology, it ensures the integrity of each vote while maintaining voter privacy and preventing double-voting through smart contract implementation.

## 🌟 **Features**  

### 👨‍💻 **User Features**  
- 🔐 **Secure Voting**: Implementation of blockchain technology for tamper-proof voting
- 👤 **User Authentication**: Secure voter verification through blockchain accounts
- 📊 **Real-time Results**: Live vote count updates
- 🖥️ **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive GUI for voting
- 📈 **Vote Tracking**: Ability to view candidate statistics
- 🛡️ **Double-vote Prevention**: Smart contract ensures each voter can only vote once

---  

## 💡 **Motivation**  
In an era where digital security and transparency are paramount, BVS aims to revolutionize the voting process by leveraging blockchain technology. This system ensures that every vote is securely recorded, immutable, and verifiable while maintaining voter privacy.

## 📝 **How To Use BVS**  

### ⚙️ **Setup Steps**  
1. 🔧 Set up a local Ganache blockchain server.  
2. 📥 Deploy the voting smart contract using the provided Solidity code.  
3. 🔑 Configure your Ethereum account and private key in the `main.py` file.  
   - Update `account1`, `account2`, and `private_key` with your actual Ethereum account details.  
4. 🚀 Launch the voting application.  
   - Run `main.py`. You will be prompted to enter the RPC server URL (default is `http://127.0.0.1:7545`).  
5. ✅ Select your candidate and submit your vote.  
   - After selecting a candidate, the application will send your vote to the blockchain and display the transaction hash.  
6. 📊 View the results in real-time by calling the `getCandidateCount` and `getCandidate` functions in the smart contract.  
   - The application will display the current vote counts for each candidate.
